## The Night That Built This Product

It was an ordinary evening at home when my mother suddenly clutched her chest and slid down against the wall. Her face was pale, her breathing was shallow, and I was alone. I did what any Indian kid is taught to do first — I dialed **112**.

> *"The call connected. Then a hold tone. Then silence. Then the line dropped."*

I dialed **102** for the state ambulance. **"Number busy."**
I dialed the local private ambulance number I had saved in my phone a year ago. **"The number you are trying to reach is not in service."**
I tried two more from a Google search. **One didn't pick up. The other said they had no vehicle free for the next 40 minutes.**

Every clock in the house suddenly felt very loud.

With the neighbor's help, I pushed my mother into a car and drove to the **nearest hospital** — eight minutes away. The triage nurse took one look at the ECG and said the words you never want to hear:

> *"We are not equipped for this. You have to take her to a cardiac center. Now."*

No patient transfer ambulance. No stretcher protocol. No phone call ahead to the next hospital. We went back into the same car. **Twenty-two more minutes** of honking through traffic until we finally reached a tertiary cardiac hospital. The doctors admitted her. They asked for her medical history. I had nothing — no paper, no app, no records. I answered from memory while she was being wheeled into the cath lab.

By God's grace, **she survived.** I sat outside the ICU that night and couldn't stop replaying one thought:

**How many families are not that lucky?**

That night, I didn't grieve. I got angry. And I started building.

**EmergencyOS was born that night.**

## The Gaps I Saw — And The Numbers Behind Them

What I lived through wasn't bad luck. It is the **default emergency experience** for most of India and the developing world. The data is brutal:

| Reality | Number |
|---|---|
| Indians who die every year from **delayed emergency medical care** | **~3 million** <sup>(NCRB, AIIMS trauma reports)</sup> |
| Deaths in road accidents in India per year — most in the **Golden Hour** | **~1,68,000** (2022) <sup>(MoRTH)</sup> |
| % of cardiac arrest victims who survive outside a hospital in India | **< 1 %** <sup>(vs. 10–12 % in the US / 25 % in Seattle)</sup> |
| Drop in cardiac arrest survival **per minute** without CPR/defibrillation | **~10 %** <sup>(American Heart Association)</sup> |
| Average urban ambulance response time in Indian Tier-2/3 cities | **25–45 minutes** <sup>(WHO SEARO 2022)</sup> |
| Target response time in Germany / UK | **8–12 minutes** |
| % of Indian ambulance calls that reach the **wrong-specialty hospital** | **~30 %** forcing a second transfer |
| % of patients who arrive at the hospital with **zero accessible medical history** | **~85 %** |
| Indians who still rely on 2G / feature phones (no smartphone apps) | **~25 crore (250 million)** |

The real killer isn't the disease. It is the **minutes** we lose between the symptom and the right bed. EmergencyOS exists to close that gap — with intelligence, redundancy, and grace.

## The Solution — EmergencyOS

> **Tagline:** *Designed to save lives.*

EmergencyOS is not a "call an ambulance" app. It is an **end-to-end emergency operating system** that connects six roles — **Victim → Citizen Volunteer → EMS Fleet → Hospital → Ops Command → Emergency Contact** — into one real-time, AI-coordinated, offline-capable command mesh.

It is built on Google Cloud, Firebase, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Google Maps Platform, and LiveKit WebRTC — and deployed as **three synchronized apps** that share a single live brain.

### One sentence for a grandmother

*"You press one button. The right ambulance, the right hospital, the right volunteer nearby, and the right AI doctor's voice all arrive together — even if there is no internet."*

## Three Apps. One Brain.

EmergencyOS ships as **three separately compiled and hosted apps** that all share the same Firestore backend, the same dispatch engine, and the same AI.

<div align="center">

| App | Target | Who uses it | Entry point |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EmergencyOS — Main App** | Android · iOS · Web | Citizens, patients, volunteers, families | `lib/main.dart` |
| **Command Center — Admin Dashboard** | Web | Operations staff, government command rooms | `lib/main_admin.dart` |
| **Fleet Panel — EMS Operator App** | Web | Ambulance drivers and dispatchers | `lib/main_fleet.dart` |

</div>

**Every click in one app is visible in the other two within ~500ms** — because they all listen to the same Firestore documents and share the same LiveKit rooms for voice.

## The Use of AI — Gemini as a System, Not a Chatbot

AI in EmergencyOS is not a demo feature bolted on. **Gemini 2.5 Flash is used at four distinct points in the lifecycle of every incident.**

| # | Where | What Gemini does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Intake — Triage Vision** | Victim or bystander can snap a photo. Gemini Vision classifies incident type (cardiac / RTA / fire / burn / fall / drowning), estimates severity, detects visible blood and hazards, and returns a confidence score. Drives which services are dispatched. |
| 2 | **On-scene — LIFELINE First-Aid Copilot** | A voice & chat AI that walks a panicked bystander through CPR, bleeding control, burns, choking, seizures, strokes, anaphylaxis, drowning — step by step, in their native language. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash via Cloud Function, with a local offline knowledge base as fallback. |
| 3 | **Command — Situation Brief** | Every 5 minutes, for every active incident, a Cloud Function regenerates a Gemini scene brief from volunteer reports + photos + video + status history. Ops staff always see one paragraph of fresh ground truth. |
| 4 | **Analytics — Ops AI Chat** | The admin dashboard has an embedded Gemini chat that can answer *"which hex had the slowest response last week?"* or *"summarize all cardiac incidents in zone 3 today"* — grounded on live Firestore analytics. |

### LIFELINE Copilot — the always-on voice assistant

Every logged-in user also has a **personal voice agent** on `copilot_{uid}` — a private LiveKit WebRTC room powered by **OpenAI Realtime** with `@livekit/noise-cancellation-node`. It has tools to:

- Read which screen the user is on and coach them through it hands-free
- Look up any medical protocol on demand
- Request an SOS trigger (the user must confirm) — so an elderly user can literally say *"call an ambulance, I think I'm having a heart attack"* and the chain fires.

---

## Reliability — Engineered for the Worst Day

Emergency systems fail people exactly when they are needed most. EmergencyOS is designed with the assumption that **everything will go wrong.**

| Failure mode | How EmergencyOS handles it |
|---|---|
| **Volunteer's FCM token is stale** | 3 independent FCM layers (geo, topic, all-users). One failure never silences the others. |
| **Hospital ignores the dispatch** | 2-minute acceptance window → auto-escalates to the next best hospital. `hospitalDispatchEscalation` runs every minute. |
| **Ambulance operator doesn't respond** | 3-minute window → auto-escalates to the next-nearest fleet unit. `ambulanceDispatchEscalation` runs every minute. |
| **Gemini API key is down** | Local offline first-aid knowledge base (19 levels, curriculum-grade) keeps serving guidance. |
| **Google Maps WebGL fails** | `flutter_map` CPU-renderer fallback kicks in. |
| **User has no mobile data — only 2G SMS** | Twilio GeoSMS webhook (`parseSmsGateway`) creates a real Firestore incident from a text message. Victim gets SMS status back. |
| **Rate-limit spam** | Rate-limit **flags** an incident but **never blocks dispatch**. Real emergencies cannot be missed to prevent abuse. This is the single most important design rule in the system. |
| **App crashes mid-SOS** | `sos_incidents` doc is durable in Firestore — re-opening the app resumes the same live ETA. |
| **Incident gets forgotten** | Hard 1-hour TTL → `expireStaleSosIncidents` archives and notifies. No zombie incidents. |
| **Third-party sensor system** | `onExternalIncidentTrigger` HTTP webhook with shared-secret auth lets IoT devices (AEDs, fall detectors, partner apps) create incidents. |

**Every state change is observable.** The admin dashboard's `ops_dashboard_alerts` feed shows every dispatch event live — hospital notified, declined, exhausted, no beds, ambulance accepted, ambulance expired, volunteer accepted, volunteer on scene.

---

## Offline Capabilities — Because Bandwidth Disappears in Disasters

When a flood, fire, or blackout hits, cellular coverage is the first thing to collapse. EmergencyOS is one of the few emergency apps that actually works when the network is broken.

| Subsystem | Offline behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Firestore** | Offline persistence enabled, 50 MB cache. SOS writes queue and sync when signal returns. |
| **`OfflineCacheService`** | Pre-caches the user's active incident, medical history, emergency contacts, and last-known ambulance position. |
| **`OfflineKnowledgeService`** | Full 19-level first-aid curriculum (CPR, choking, bleeding, burns, seizure, stroke, allergic reactions) available in 12 languages, zero network. |
| **`OfflineMapPackService`** | User can pre-download map tiles for their home zone. Incident map keeps rendering. |
| **`OfflineSosStatusService`** | If SOS fails to upload, it is queued and retried on reconnect — and an SMS is sent in parallel. |
| **TTS voice guidance** | Reads first-aid steps aloud when the screen is unreadable (dust, smoke, blood, motion). |
| **SMS GeoSMS gateway** | A user with no app at all can SMS coordinates + incident type to the gateway number and trigger a full dispatch. |
| **Native feature-phone reach** | Emergency contacts receive SMS updates — they don't need the app installed. |

---

## Dashboards — One Screen That Runs a City

The **Command Center (Admin Dashboard)** is the nerve center. This is what a city's emergency control room looks like inside EmergencyOS:

| Screen | What you see |
|---|---|
| **Command Center Map** | Hex-grid overlay (flat-top axial coordinates) over a live city map. Every active incident, every volunteer, every ambulance, every hospital with bed count. Color-coded by severity. Zoom in — see the details. Click a hex — see everyone in it. |
| **Incident Inspector** | Focus any incident. Full dispatch chain, hospital acceptance trail, fleet assignment state, volunteer roster, scene photos, Gemini situation brief, voice-bridge join button. |
| **Admin Analytics** | Response time histogram, incident type breakdown, zone heatmaps, volunteer XP trends — rendered with `fl_chart`. |
| **Fleet Management** | All ambulance units, 90-second heartbeat TTL, stationed hospital, call sign, vehicle type, live availability. |
| **Hospital Management** | All hospitals with bed availability, specialty map, onboarding wizard, pre-uploaded medical record index. |
| **Volunteer Management** | XP, level, lives saved, profile, elite tier flags, verification state. |
| **System Observatory** | Live health check — Firestore latency, LiveKit rooms, Twilio credits, Gemini key, FCM token count. A single "green / red" board for the ops lead. |
| **Impact Dashboard** | Platform-level outcomes — lives helped, incidents resolved, average response time, fastest volunteer, most-dispatched hospital. |
| **Master Comms Net** | `comms_command_net` LiveKit room — command-level voice override on *any* incident. The ops lead can speak into any active bridge. |

Hospitals get their own slice — a **Hospital Bridge** view showing the incoming patient, required services vs. capacity, scene photos, pre-loaded medical history, and a 2-minute dispatch acceptance button.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK `^3.11.3`
- Node.js 22+ (required for Cloud Functions; matches `functions/package.json` engines field)
- Firebase CLI
- A Firebase project with Firestore, Auth, FCM, Storage, and App Check enabled

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shikhar1809/EmergencyOS_Google_Solution_Challenge.git
cd EmergencyOS_Google_Solution_Challenge
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Configure Firebase

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```

### 3. Cloud Functions

```bash
cd functions
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in: GEMINI_API_KEY, LIVEKIT_URL, LIVEKIT_API_KEY,
#         TWILIO_* (optional), WEBHOOK_SHARED_SECRET (optional)
firebase functions:secrets:set LIVEKIT_API_SECRET
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### 4. LiveKit Agents

```bash
# Lifeline voice agent (reads important comms in emergency room)
cd livekit-agent/lifeline-agent
npm install && cp .env.example .env.local && npm run dev

# Copilot voice agent (persistent per-user assistant)
cd ../copilot-agent
npm install && cp .env.example .env.local && npm run dev
```

### 5. Run the three apps

```bash
# Main citizen app
flutter run -t lib/main.dart

# Admin / command center
flutter run -t lib/main_admin.dart

# Fleet operator panel
flutter run -t lib/main_fleet.dart
```

### 6. Deploy to Firebase Hosting (all three targets)

```bash
flutter build web --release --dart-define RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_key
# Repeat with --target lib/main_admin.dart --output build/web-admin
# Repeat with --target lib/main_fleet.dart  --output build/web-fleet
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Environment Variables

### `functions/.env`

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Yes | Google Generative AI key |
| `LIVEKIT_URL` | Yes* | `wss://your-project.livekit.cloud` |
| `LIVEKIT_HTTP_URL` | Yes* | Alternative to `LIVEKIT_URL` |
| `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` | Yes | LiveKit API key |
| `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` | Yes | LiveKit secret (Firebase Secret Manager) |
| `LIFELINE_LIVEKIT_AGENT_NAME` | No | Default: `lifeline` |
| `COPILOT_LIVEKIT_AGENT_NAME` | No | Default: `copilot` |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Optional | SMS gateway |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Optional | Twilio auth |
| `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` | Optional | Sender number |
| `WEBHOOK_SHARED_SECRET` | Optional | Third-party incident webhook |

### LiveKit Agents (`.env.local`)

`LIVEKIT_URL` · `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` · `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` · `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Browser-side key hardening

Only two keys are shipped to the browser today: the Firebase Web API key (in
`lib/firebase_options.dart`) and the Google Maps JavaScript API key (in
`web/index.html`). Both must be tightened in Google Cloud Console before any
public launch:

- **Firebase Web API key** — restrict to the Firebase Hosting origins
  (`*.web.app`, `*.firebaseapp.com`, and your custom domain). Firestore and
  Auth are already gated by project rules and App Check, so the key is an
  identifier rather than a secret, but restriction prevents cross-project
  abuse.
- **Google Maps JS API key** — set an HTTP-referrer allowlist identical to
  the hosting origins and restrict it to the Maps JavaScript, Places, and
  Geocoding APIs only. Keep billing quotas conservative.
- **Gemini** — never ship a client-side key. All Gemini calls go through
  Cloud Functions (`functions/` reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` from Secret Manager).
  The `GEMINI_API_KEY` dart-define in legacy debug paths is deprecated; treat
  it as test-only.

## Key Design Decisions (Why it is built this way)

**Why hex-grid dispatch and not simple radius?**
Hex grids have uniform neighbor distance in all 6 directions — no nearest-corner bias. The flat-top axial coordinate system allows precise *ring-0 → ring-5* escalation with consistent km spacing, matching how real cities actually zone themselves.

**Why 3-layer FCM and not just one?**
Layer 1 (geo-multicast) may fail if volunteers' tokens are stale. Layer 2 (topic) guarantees subscribers get it. Layer 3 (all-users) is the last-ditch safety net. Each layer runs **independently** — one failure never silences another.

**Why fail-open on SOS rate limiting?**
Real emergencies cannot be missed for the sake of preventing spam. Rate-limit violations are *flagged* — dispatch still fires. Ops can review flagged incidents afterwards.

**Why three separate hosted web targets?**
Admin and fleet have different root routes, different auth guards, different navigation shells, and even different Firebase options. Separate builds allow independent deploys and role-based CDN isolation.

**Why LiveKit over proprietary WebRTC?**
LiveKit is open, self-hostable, and exposes an `AgentDispatchClient` that lets Cloud Functions push AI voice agents into rooms — critical for a system that must not depend on a single commercial provider during a disaster.

## 12 Languages, One Voice

App UI, LIFELINE responses, and TTS voice guidance available in:

**English · हिन्दी · தமிழ் · తెలుగు · ಕನ್ನಡ · മലയാളം · বাংলা · मराठी · ગુજરાતી · ਪੰਜਾਬੀ · ଓଡ଼ିଆ · اردو**

Gemini responds in the user's language via `replyLocale`. TTS uses the BCP-47 locale for native speech synthesis. To regenerate:

```bash
export GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=your_key
python scripts/generate_dashboard_translations.py
```
